# moss-robot-arms
moss-robot-arms Beta version 1.0.

A repository for affordable, easy-to-assemble robot arms designed for teleoperation applications. Note: This initial version arm uses the [SO-100 Arm](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) Gripper. Future iterations will have an off the shelf gripper.

### Assembling the Parts
Construct the leader and follower arms using the Assembly Video linked below. After you assemble the two arms from the video, power the leader arm using the 5V power supply, and the follower arm using the 12V power supply. In addition, plug each arm into your computer using a USB-C cable.

TODO(jess-moss): Add assembly video.

### Configure
While this robot can be programmed in a variety of manners, it is suggested to use with [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/7_get_started_with_real_robot.md).
